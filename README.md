### Hi there 👋

I'm Os, a passionate full-stack developer, open-source enthusiast, and Release Manager at [Pressbooks](https://github.com/pressbooks). I'm constantly building and experimenting with projects that integrate **OpenAI** and **React/React Native** to push the boundaries of what's possible in mobile and web development.

- 🔭 **Current Focus**: Automating workflows, refining user experiences, and building robust solutions with OpenAI, React/Native, Flutter, and Laravel.
- 🌱 **Self-Care Journey**: Exploring the balance between tech and life—focusing on fitness, wellness, and mental sharpness to stay energized and sharp every day. 💪🏻 🧪 📚 🧠
- 💬 **Let's Talk About**: React/Native, Laravel, Flutter, Firebase, PHP, APIs, GitHub Actions, OpenAI, mobile app development, or any tech that's helping shape the future.
- 💡 **Favorite Tools**: I live in IntelliJ IDEs, constantly tinkering with GitHub workflows, and I’m a fan of **TypeScript**, **Laravel**, and **Dart**.
- 📫 **Reach Out**: You can contact me at **os(a)icode.mx**.
