# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Os

What's cooking? I'm that dev who somehow turns caffeine into code while blasting Portishead. Think of me as a digital albaÃ±il who builds stuff that doesn't fall apart (usually ðŸ˜…).

## ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ The Essential Os

Imagine a Mexican guy who traded tacos for poutine - yep, that's me, now living my best life in Montreal. Plot twist: turns out this chilango actually LOVES winter! You'll find me hunting for the perfect cafÃ© con leche in Rosemont's coziest spots, leaving snowy bike tracks all over the city (yes, even in -20Â°C, call me loco). When I'm not trying to convince Canadians that "picante" doesn't mean death by spice, I'm:

- Vibing to Lhasa while coding in some hidden cafÃ© corner (Lhasa de Sela makes bugs disappear, I swear)
- Attempting to explain to my mom that no, I don't "fix printers, or configure androids" for a living
- Mixing Mexican sarcasm with French Canadian politeness (it's an... interesting combo)
- Mapping out every single bike path in Montreal like it's my personal mission

## ðŸ’» Mi Chamba (That's "My Work" for you non-Mexicans)

I juggle with (talachas):
- JavaScript (porque el dolor es temporal)
- PHP (don't judge, obviously Laravel)
- WP plugins ecosystem [Pressbooks](https://github.com/pressbooks) (come on, it pays the bills)
- React Native & Flutter (because apparently one mobile framework wasn't enough pain)

## ðŸŽµ When Not in la Chamba

- Getting lost in trip-hop rabbitholes (Elysian Fields is life)
- I like music and I want to be better at it [Sometimes I play some stuff](https://www.youtube.com/@OsArz)
- Building [MotaMeet](https://motameet.com) - an app for connecting people (like a digital compadre-finder)
- Creating [DesafÃ­o de hÃ¡bitos](https://desafiodehabitos.com) - because someone needs to guilt-track your failed New Year's resolutions
- Finding new cafÃ©s to code in (my life is basically a tour of Montreal's best wifi spots)

## ðŸŒŸ Random Facts That Nobody Asked For

- I once tried explaining React hooks to my taquero - he still makes better lifecycle decisions than me
- My life, like my salsa preferences, ranges from "mild" to "why would you do this to yourself?"
- I believe trip-hop and coding share the same vibe - both are about finding rhythm in chaos
- Yes, I bike in snowstorms. No, I'm not crazy (debatable)

## ðŸ“« VÃ¡monos recio
(That's "Hit me up" but more Mexican)

- [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/init_sh) - Where I tweet about code, life, and why guacamole shouldn't cost extra
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/oscararzola) - For the professional-ish version of me
- [Email](mailto:os@icode.mx) - If you're old school like that
- [Instagram](https://instagram.com/os.coder) - Where the FOMO resides

Â¡Hasta la vista, baby!  

P.S. If you got this far, you deserve a virtual taco ðŸŒ® (and maybe a hot wine for the cold Montreal days)
