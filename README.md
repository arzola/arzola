# 👋 I'm Os

What's cooking? I'm that dev who somehow turns caffeine into code while blasting Portishead. Think of me as a digital albañil who builds stuff that doesn't fall apart (usually 😅).

## 🇲🇽 The Essential Os

Imagine a Mexican guy who traded tacos for poutine - yep, that's me, now living my best life in Montreal. Plot twist: turns out this chilango actually LOVES winter! You'll find me hunting for the perfect café con leche in Rosemont's coziest spots, leaving snowy bike tracks all over the city (yes, even in -20°C, call me loco). When I'm not trying to convince Canadians that "picante" doesn't mean death by spice, I'm:

- Vibing to Portishead while coding in some hidden café corner (Beth Gibbons makes bugs disappear, I swear)
- Attempting to explain to my mom that no, I don't "fix printers" for a living
- Mixing Mexican sarcasm with French Canadian politeness (it's an... interesting combo)
- Mapping out every single bike path in Montreal like it's my personal mission

## 💻 Mi Chamba (That's "My Work" for you non-Mexicans)

I juggle with:
- JavaScript (porque el dolor es temporal)
- PHP (don't judge)
- React Native & Flutter (because apparently one mobile framework wasn't enough pain)

## 🎵 When Not Coding

- Getting lost in trip-hop rabbitholes (Elysian Fields is life)
- Building MotaMeet - an app for connecting people (like a digital compadre-finder)
- Creating Desafío de hábitos - because someone needs to guilt-track your failed New Year's resolutions
- Finding new cafés to code in (my life is basically a tour of Montreal's best wifi spots)

## 🌟 Random Facts That Nobody Asked For

- I once tried explaining React hooks to my taquero - he still makes better lifecycle decisions than me
- My code, like my salsa preferences, ranges from "mild" to "why would you do this to yourself?"
- I believe trip-hop and coding share the same vibe - both are about finding rhythm in chaos
- Yes, I bike in snowstorms. No, I'm not crazy (debatable)

- [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/init_sh) - Where I tweet about code, life, and why guacamole shouldn't cost extra
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/oscararzola) - For the professional-ish version of me
- [Email](mailto:os@icode.mx) - If you're old school like that

¡Hasta la vista, baby!

P.S. If you got this far, you deserve a virtual taco 🌮 (and maybe a hot chocolate for the cold Montreal days)
