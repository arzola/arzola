# Hey, I'm Os

I'm a developer from Mexico City who somehow ended up in Montreal, and honestly? Best decision ever. Turns out this chilango actually loves winter - go figure.

You'll probably find me biking around Rosemont looking for the perfect café con leche, even when it's -20°C (yeah, I know, I'm that guy). When I'm not trying to explain to locals that "picante" won't actually kill them, I'm usually coding to some Jay Jay Johanson or Lhasa de Sela.

## What I Do

I work mostly with PHP (Laravel, don't @ me) and JavaScript, plus some React Native and Flutter when mobile projects come up. Currently doing a lot with the WordPress ecosystem at [Pressbooks](https://github.com/pressbooks) - turns out building educational publishing tools pays the bills pretty well.

The funny thing is, my mom still thinks I "fix computers and configure phones" for a living. Close enough, right?

## Side Projects

I'm building a couple things on the side:
- **MotaMeet** - an app for connecting people, like a digital way to find your crew
- **Desafío de hábitos** - basically guilt-tracking your failed resolutions, but in a helpful way

## When I'm Not Coding

I'm pretty obsessed with trip-hop music - there's something about that rhythm that just works with coding. I mess around with music production too, though I'm still figuring that out. You can check out some of my attempts on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@OsArz) if you're curious.

Montreal's café scene has become my second office. I've probably worked from half the spots in the city by now, always hunting for that perfect corner with good wifi and better coffee.

## Random Stuff

I once tried explaining React hooks to my favorite taquero back home - he still makes better lifecycle decisions than most of my components. My relationship with spice levels mirrors my coding philosophy: ranges from "this is fine" to "why did I think this was a good idea?"

And yeah, I really do bike in snowstorms. It's not as crazy as it sounds... okay, maybe it is.
